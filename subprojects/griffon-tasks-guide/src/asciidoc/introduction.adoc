= Introduction

The tasks plugin provides the means to schedule and manage tasks. Tasks will
always be executed off the UI thread. In many respects task execution follows
the same rules as JDK's {link_swing_worker}.

This plugin contains code written by Eike Kettner ({link_swing_tasks}).

== Creating Tasks

Tasks must implement the `{link_api_task}` interface. There is a helper class
(`AbstractTask`) which can be subclassed, for which the `execute()` method must
be implemented as a minimum. This method should contain the long running code.

The following example depicts a Task used to find the first N prime numbers

[source,java,linenumbers,options="nowrap"]
----
import griffon.plugins.tasks.Tracker;
import org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.tasks.AbstractTask;

public class PrimeNumbersTask extends AbstractTask<List<Integer>, Integer> {
    public PrimeNumbersTask(int numbersToFind) {
        //initialize
    }

    @Override
    public Integer execute(Tracker<Integer> tracker) throws Exception {
        while (!enough && !isCancelled()) {
            int number = nextPrimeNumber();
            tracker.publish(number);
            tracker.setProgress(100 * numbers.size() / numbersToFind);
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

== TaskManager

The `{link_api_task_manager}` is the entry point for scheduling tasks. It is used to create
`TaskControl` instances, register listeners and find currently running tasks.

You can provide your own implementation by binding it inside a Module.

== Executing and controlling Tasks

Use the `TaskManager` to create a `TaskControl` object and invoke its `execute()`
method.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
TaskControl taskControl = taskManager.create(new PrimeNumbersTask(10));
taskControl.execute();
----

The `execute()` method will return immediately and submit the task for
execution. Now the `{link_api_task_control}` can be used to cancel the execution of the
task. The method `waitFor()` can be invoked to wait for the task to finish.

== Listeners

You can register TaskListeners to receive notifications on tasks. There are 3
different ways to register listeners concerning the scope of events received:

 * register on TaskManager (use `taskManager.getTaskListenerSupport()`) to
   receive events for all tasks
 * register on TaskManager using a _taskId_ to receive events for tasks of the
   given _taskId_
 * register on a TaskControl (use `taskControl.getTaskContext()`) to receive
   events solely for one execution
